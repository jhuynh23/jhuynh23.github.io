User Story / Gameplay

1. Describe the gameplay.

Pong is a two-player game in which each player has an interactive paddle placed at the opposite ends of the screen.
A ball is hit back-and-forth between the two players until a player misses, losing the point.

2. What are the conditions when the game begins?

A player has to click the screen to start the game. Once the player clicks, the ball will randomly float from the center 
to a paddle (at random).

3. Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
What ifs will there be?
Visual Game Components:
What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box.
Which will be static? (the board)
Which will be animated? (the box)
What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.
Events / Logic
What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
How do those events affect the data of the program?
For each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
For example: in bouncing box, when the box is clicked:

The speed is increased
The point total goes up by 1 and is displayed on the box
The position of the box is reset to 0
